### Hi there 👋

I'm Ashley, a third-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto, specializing in Software and Control, with minors in AI and Business. I love working on projects that challenge both my creativity and technical abilities.

My interests include (but definitely aren’t limited to):
- 🔌 Embedded Systems & MCU development  
- 🛠️ Hardware-Software Integration (e.g. robotics, IoT, wearables)  
- 🤖 AI/ML
- 🎮 Game Development  
- 🖥️ Computer Architecture
- 🌐 Full-Stack Web Development  
- 🔗 Blockchain & Decentralized Applications

I’m especially driven by opportunities to take on technical leadership roles and apply all I’ve learned to solve meaningful, real-world problems.
